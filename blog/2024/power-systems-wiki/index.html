[1]</p> <hr> <p><strong><em>Frequency Regulation</em></strong> The ability of a Balancing Authority to help the Interconnection maintain Scheduled Frequency. This assistance can include both turbine governor response and Automatic Generation Control. [1]</p> <hr> <p><strong><em>Frequency Response</em></strong> (Equipment) The ability of a system or elements of the system to react or respond to a change in system frequency. (System) The sum of the change in demand, plus the change in generation, divided by the change in frequency, expressed in megawatts per 0.1 Hertz (MW/0.1 Hz). [1]</p> <hr> <p><strong><em>Area Control Error (ACE)</em></strong> Means the instantaneous difference between net actual and scheduled interchange, taking into account the effects of Frequency Bias including correction for meter error. [1]</p> <p>The mismatch between demand and generation is represented via a real-time value called <strong><em>area control error (ACE)</em></strong>, estimated in MW. [2]</p> <hr> <p><strong><em>Automatic Generation Control (AGC)</em></strong> Means equipment that automatically adjusts a Control Area’s generation from a central location to maintain its interchange schedule plus Frequency Bias. [1]</p> <hr> <p><strong><em>Primary Frequency Response</em></strong> The immediate proportional increase or decrease in real power output provided by generating units/generating facilities and the natural real power dampening response provided by Load in response to system Frequency Deviations. This response is in the direction that stabilizes frequency. [1]</p> <hr> <p><strong><em>Ramp Rate or Ramp</em></strong> (Schedule) The rate, expressed in megawatts per minute, at which the interchange schedule is attained during the ramp period. (Generator) The rate, expressed in megawatts per minute, that a generator changes its output. [1]</p> <hr> <p><strong><em>Response Rate</em></strong> The Ramp Rate that a generating unit can achieve under normal operating conditions expressed in megawatts per minute (MW/Min). [1]</p> <hr> <p><strong><em>Primary Control</em></strong> is more commonly known as <strong><em>Frequency Response</em></strong>. Frequency Response occurs within the first few seconds following a change in system frequency (disturbance) to stabilize the Interconnection. [2]</p> <hr> <p><strong><em>Secondary Control</em></strong> typically includes the balancing services deployed in the “minutes” time frame. Some resources however, such as hydroelectric generation, can respond faster in many cases. This control is accomplished using the Balancing Authority’s control computer (terms most often associated with this are <strong>“Load-Frequency Control”</strong> or <strong>“Automatic Generation Control”</strong>) and the manual actions taken by the dispatcher to provide additional adjustments. Secondary Control also includes initial reserve deployment for disturbances.</p> <p>In short, <strong><em>Secondary Control</em></strong> maintains the minute-to-minute balance throughout the day and is used to restore frequency to its scheduled value, usually 60 Hz, following a disturbance. Secondary Control is provided by both <strong>Spinning</strong> and <strong>Non-Spinning Reserves</strong>. [2]</p> <div style="text-align: ;left;"> <img src="/assets/img/poster/frequency_trend.png" alt="Typical Frequency Trend for the Loss of a Generating Resource" style="width: 700px; height: auto;"> <p><em> Typical Frequency Trend for the Loss of a Generating Resource (copied from [2]). Point A is defined as the pre-disturbance frequency; Point C or Nadir is the maximum deviation due to loss of resource; Point B is defined as the stabilizing frequency and; Point D is the time the contingent BA begins the recovery from the loss of resource. </em></p> </div> <hr> <p><strong><em>Tertiary Control</em></strong> encompasses actions taken to get resources in place to handle current and future contingencies. Reserve deployment and Reserve restoration following a disturbance are common types of Tertiary Control. [2]</p> <hr> <p><strong><em>Control Performance Standard 1 (CPS1)</em></strong> is a <strong>yearly</strong> standard that measures impact on frequency error, with a 100 percent minimum allowable score. CPS1 assigns each Control Area a share of the responsibility for control of Interconnection frequency. [2]</p> <p><strong><em>Control Performance Standard 2 (CPS2)</em></strong> is a <strong>monthly</strong> standard intended to limit unscheduled flows. The minimum allowable CPS2 score is 90 percent. [2]</p> <h2 id="entities">Entities</h2> <p><strong><em>Balancing Authorities</em></strong> The responsible entity that integrates resource plans ahead of time, maintains Demand and resource balance within a Balancing Authority Area, and supports Interconnection frequency in real time. [1]</p> <hr> <p><strong><em>Interconnection</em></strong> A geographic area in which the operation of Bulk Power System components is synchronized such that the failure of one or more of such components may adversely affect the ability of the operators of other components within the system to maintain Reliable Operation of the Facilities within their control. When capitalized, any one of the four major electric system networks in North America: Eastern, Western, ERCOT and Quebec. [1]</p> <hr> <p><strong><em>Reliability Coordinator Area</em></strong> The collection of generation, transmission, and loads within the boundaries of the Reliability Coordinator. Its boundary coincides with one or more Balancing Authority Areas.</p> <hr> <p><strong><em>Interchange</em></strong> Energy transfers that cross Balancing Authority boundaries. [1]</p> <hr> <h2 id="reserve">Reserve</h2> <p><strong><em>Spinning Reserve</em></strong> Unloaded generation that is synchronized and ready to serve additional demand. [1]</p> <hr> <p><strong><em>Non-Spinning Reserve</em></strong> 1. That generating reserve <strong>not connected</strong> to the system but capable of serving demand <strong>within a specified time</strong>. 2. Interruptible load that can be removed from the system in a specified time. [1]</p> <hr> <p><strong><em>Operating Reserve</em></strong> That capability above firm system demand required to provide for regulation, load forecasting error, equipment forced and scheduled outages and local area protection. It consists of spinning and non-spinning reserve. [1]</p> <hr> <p><strong><em>Operating Reserve – Spinning</em></strong> The portion of Operating Reserve consisting of: • Generation synchronized to the system and fully available to serve load within the Disturbance Recovery Period following the contingency event; or • Load fully removable from the system within the Disturbance Recovery Period following the contingency event. [1]</p> <hr> <p><strong><em>Operating Reserve – Supplemental</em></strong> The portion of Operating Reserve consisting of: • Generation (synchronized or capable of being synchronized to the system) that is fully available to serve load within the Disturbance Recovery Period following the contingency event; or • Load fully removable from the system within the Disturbance Recovery Period following the contingency event. [1]</p> <hr> <p><strong><em>Regulating Reserve</em></strong> An amount of reserve responsive to Automatic Generation Control, which is sufficient to provide normal regulating margin. [1]</p> <hr> <p><strong><em>Contingency Reserve</em></strong> The provision of capacity deployed by the Balancing Authority to meet the Disturbance Control Standard (DCS) and other NERC and Regional Reliability Organization contingency requirements. [1]</p> <div style="text-align: ;left;"> <img src="/assets/img/poster/operating_reserve.png" alt="Operating Reserves" style="width: 700px; height: auto;"> <p><em>Operating Reserves (from referenced document) </em></p> </div> <hr> <h2 id="reliability-security-and-stability">Reliability, Security, and Stability</h2> <p><strong><em>Stability Limit</em></strong> The maximum power flow possible through some particular point in the system while maintaining stability in the entire system or the part of the system to which the stability limit refers. [1]</p> <hr> <p><strong><em>Interconnection Reliability Operating Limit</em></strong> A System Operating Limit that, if violated, could lead to instability, uncontrolled separation, or Cascading outages that adversely impact the reliability of the Bulk Electric System. [1]</p> <hr> <p><strong><em>Interconnection Reliability Operating Limit Tv</em></strong> <strong>The maximum time</strong> that an Interconnection Reliability Operating Limit can be violated before the risk to the interconnection or other Reliability Coordinator Area(s) becomes greater than acceptable. Each Interconnection Reliability Operating Limit’s Tv shall be less than or equal to 30 minutes. [1]</p> <hr> <p><strong><em>Reliability</em></strong> of a power system refers to the probability of its satisfactory operation over the long run. It denotes the ability to supply adequate electric service on a nearly continuous basis, with few interruptions over an extended time period. [3]</p> <hr> <p><strong><em>Security</em></strong> of a power system refers to the degree of risk in its ability to survive imminent disturbances (contingencies) without interruption of customer service. It relates to robustness of the system to imminent disturbances and, hence, depends on the system operating condition as well as the contingent probability of disturbances. [3]</p> <hr> <p><strong><em>Stability</em></strong> The ability of an electric system to maintain a state of equilibrium during normal and abnormal conditions or disturbances. [1]</p> <p><strong><em>Stability</em></strong> is the ability of an electric power system, for a given initial operating condition, to regain a state of operating equilibrium after being subjected to a physical disturbance, with most system variables bounded so that practically the entire system remains intact. [4]</p> <p><strong><em>Stability</em></strong> of a power system refers to the continuance of intact operation following a disturbance. It depends on the operating condition and the nature of the physical disturbance. [3]</p> <p>Their relationships [3]:</p> <ol> <li>Reliability is the overall objective in power system design and operation. To be reliable, the power system must be secure most of the time. To be secure, the system must be stable but must also be secure against other contingencies that would not be classified as stability problems e.g., damage to equipment such as an explosive failure of a cable, fall of transmission towers due to ice loading or sabotage. As well, a system may be stable following a contingency, yet insecure due to post-fault system conditions resulting in equipment overloads or voltage violations.</li> <li>System security may be further distinguished from stability in terms of the resulting consequences. For example, two systems may both be stable with equal stability margins, but one may be relatively more secure because the consequences of instability are less severe.</li> <li>Security and stability are time-varying attributes which can be judged by studying the performance of the power system under a particular set of conditions. Reliability, on the other hand, is a function of the time-average performance of the power system; it can only be judged by consideration of the system’s behavior over an appreciable period of time.</li> </ol> <hr> <h3 id="stability">Stability</h3> <p><strong><em>Rotor angle stability</em></strong> is concerned with the ability of the interconnected synchronous machines in a power system to remain in synchronism under normal operating conditions and to regain synchronism after being subjected to a small or large disturbance. [4]</p> <hr> <p><strong><em>Voltage stability</em></strong> refers to the ability of a power system to maintain steady voltages close to nominal value at all buses in the system after being subjected to a disturbance. [4]</p> <hr> <p><strong><em>Frequency stability</em></strong> refers to the ability of a power system to maintain steady frequency following a severe system upset resulting in a significant imbalance between generation and load. [3]</p> <hr> <p>There are also two categories of stability: <strong><em>Resonance Stability</em></strong> and <strong><em>Converter-driven Stability</em></strong>. [3]</p> <hr> <h2 id="contingency">Contingency</h2> <p><strong><em>Most Severe Single Contingency</em></strong> The Balancing Contingency Event, due to a single contingency identified using system models maintained within the Reserve Sharing Group (RSG) or a Balancing Authority’s area that is not part of a Reserve Sharing Group, that would result in <strong>the greatest loss</strong> (measured in MW) of resource output used by the RSG or a Balancing Authority that is not participating as a member of a RSG at the time of the event to meet Firm Demand and export obligation (excluding export obligation for which Contingency Reserve obligations are being met by the Sink Balancing Authority). [1]</p> <hr> <p><strong><em>Disturbance</em></strong> Means (i) any perturbation to the electric system, or (ii) the unexpected change in ACE that is caused by the sudden loss of generation or interruption of load. [1]</p> <hr> <h2 id="horizon">Horizon</h2> <p><strong><em>Near-Term Transmission Planning Horizon</em></strong> The transmission planning period that covers Year One through five. [1]</p> <hr> <p><strong><em>Long-Term Transmission Planning Horizon</em></strong> Transmission planning period that covers years six through ten or beyond when required to accommodate any known longer lead time projects that may take longer than ten years to complete. [1]</p> <hr> <h2 id="factors">Factors</h2> <p><strong><em>Outage Transfer Distribution Factor (OTDF)</em></strong> In the post-contingency configuration of a system under study, the electric Power Transfer Distribution Factor (PTDF) with one or more system Facilities removed from service (outaged). [1]</p> <hr> <p><strong><em>Participation Factors</em></strong> A set of dispatch rules such that given a specific amount of load to serve, an <strong>approximate generation</strong> dispatch can be determined. To accomplish this, generators are assigned a percentage that they will contribute to serve load.
