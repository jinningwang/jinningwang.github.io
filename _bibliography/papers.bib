The development of an EV dynamic model based on an Western Electricity Coordinating Council dynamic model is introduced ﬁrst, then the T\&D dynamic co-simulation platform is described. The advantage of the overall platform is that distributed energy resources, such as distributed photovoltaics and EVs, are modeled explicitly in both transmission and distribution simulators for frequency and voltage dynamics, respectively. The case studies simulate the frequency responses (i.e., primary and/or secondary) of the EVs after the system is exposed to an N-1 contingency, such as a generation trip. Various EV frequency regulation participation strategies are also investigated to study their impacts on system frequency response. The studies shows that EVs have the potential capability to provide effective frequency regulation services.},

From the aspects of algorithm complexity, difficulty in parameter design, immunity to interference, dynamic characteristics and steadystate characteristics, the optimal scheme for extracting the FFPS current from source current and the applications of the remaining extraction schemes are obtained.

	abstract = {Abstract
            The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has resulted in changes in productivity and daily life patterns, and as a result electricity consumption (EC) has also shifted. In this paper, we construct estimates of EC changes at the metropolitan level across the continental U.S., including total EC and residential EC during the initial two months of the pandemic. The total and residential data on the state level were broken down into the county level, and then metropolitan level EC estimates were aggregated from the counties included in each metropolitan statistical area (MSA). This work shows that the reduction in total EC is related to the shares of certain industries in an MSA, whereas regardless of the incidence level or economic structure, the residential sector shows a trend of increasing EC across the continental U.S. Since the MSAs account for 86\% of the total population and 87\% of the total EC of the continental U.S., the analytical result in this paper can provide important guidelines for future social-economic crises.},
